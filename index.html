<a href="http://sniffmap.telcomap.org/">http://sniffmap.telcomap.org/</a>

<p><a href="http://sniffmap.telcomap.org/">Sniffmap</a> is a project to map the potential Internet mass interception performed by NSA and its allies (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand). Since Edward Snowden disclosure, the security space has changed: rumors have been confirmed, data points have been available and new knowledge about security exposure and attack vectors is now known. This project tries to put this in easy to grasp visual representation, within the bigger context of TelcoMap.org.</p>

<p>Actually, we get route data not only per country but also per ISP and operator, but for now we didn't find a way to visualize that neatly. </p>

<h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research methodology</h3>

<p>As stated in the fateful NSA document, many telecommunication links go through USA and its allies to connect two other countries. This is due to least cost routing and link usage. Therefore, NSA can leverage on this to capture a lot of traffic that otherwise would not go through its points of interception.</p>

<p>To create our dataset, we try to detect each time an internet route between two IP addresses pass by an NSA controlled country and therefore can be considered as intercepted. As you'll see, around 80% of the Internet is captured by NSA and allies.</p>

<p>Our metholody is the following
<ol>
	<LI>Choose a random list of target IP address</LI>
	<LI>For each country take all known traceroute gateways</LI>
	<LI>For each traceroute gateways test each target IP address</LI>
	<LI>If this route goes through one NSA-controlled country, mark the route as "bad"</LI>
	<LI>Compute percentage over all routes for a given country (using multiple traceroute gateways hence hopefully multiple ISPs and operators to have meaningful results)</LI>
</ol>
</p>

<h2><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known bias</h2>

<p>There are a few known bias
<ul>
	<LI>Results are dependent on the variety of traceroute source (i.e. traceroute http gateways, looking glass, local shell access, ...).</LI>
	<LI>Results are dependent on the fact that even if traceroute sources are varied, they should be depending of different BGP AS (Autonomous Systems) in order to really represent the country's traffic.</LI>
	<LI>This analysis is not weighted by country's traffic quantity per AS, thus it is a percentage of _routes_ potentially intercepted, not of quantity of traffic intercepted.</LI>
	<LI>Not only NSA and the "Five Eyes" allies are intercepting Internet traffic. It seems to have become a popular sport these days. So you can expect also some other countries to intercept and therefore the real stats should be much higher.</LI>
	<LI>We're depending on geographic IP lookup data tables to determine location of routers. Since these cannot be 100% accurate, our stats are biased.</LI>
	<LI>On a given route, the fact that a router is attributed to one country does not clears other routers as these could also be compromised by NSA and allies or even owned by a collaborating company.</LI>
	<LI>The routes shown by traceroute may not show the underlying physical nor layer 2 network topology, such as MPLS, satellite links or fiber optic (DWDM or else) network. Therefore, this is another risk of interception and another set of location for such interceptions.</LI>
</ul>

<h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Join us!</h3>

<p>As you can see, many countries do not have measurement yet. You can help improve this by providing us HTTP traceroute gateways or shells for the countries that are missing. To do this, simply clone the github repository, get our ssh public key, and add it to one machine in the relevant country.</p>
