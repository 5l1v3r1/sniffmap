<p>Sniffmap is a project to map the potential Internet mass interception performed by NSA and its allies (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand).</p>

<a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130606193143-02-nsa-prism-horizontal-gallery.jpg"><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130606193143-02-nsa-prism-horizontal-gallery.jpg"></a>

<p>Actually, we get route data not only per country but also per ISP and operator, but for now we didn't find a way to visualize that neatly. </p>

<h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research methodology</h3>

<p>As stated in the fateful NSA document, many telecommunication links go through USA and its allies to connect two other countries. This is due to least cost routing and link usage. Therefore, NSA can leverage on this to capture a lot of traffic that otherwise would not go through its points of interception.</p>

<p>To create our dataset, we try to detect each time an internet route between two IP addresses pass by an NSA controlled country and therefore can be considered as intercepted. As you'll see, around 80% of the Internet is captured by NSA and allies.</p>

<p>Our metholody is the following
<ol>
	<LI>Choose a random list of target IP address</LI>
	<LI>For each country take all known traceroute gateways</LI>
	<LI>For each traceroute gateways test each target IP address</LI>
	<LI>If this route goes through one NSA-controlled country, mark the route as "bad"</LI>
	<LI>Compute percentage over all routes for a given country (using multiple traceroute gateways hence hopefully multiple ISPs and operators to have meaningful results)</LI>
	<LI></LI>
</ol>
</p>

<h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Join us!</h3>

<p>As you can see, many countries do not have measurement yet. You can help improve this by providing us HTTP traceroute gateways or shells for the countries that are missing. To do this, simply clone the github repository, get our ssh public key, and add it to one machine in the relevant country.</p>
